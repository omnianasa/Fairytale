A complete project designed to apply **style transfer** to images, videos, and audio, with the goal of generating high quality videos that demonstrate the creative power of this technique.

It works by:
1. Extracting frames from a video.
2. Applying style transfer to each frame individually.
3. Reconstructing the final video from the styled frames.

### Version 2 - CycleGAN Image video frame transfer

In the second version, the project focus on the using cycle GAN
1. It extracts more frames to make the video more smooth
2. Applying cycle GAN on each frame using 50, 200, 500 epochs
3. make the video again from the styled frames
